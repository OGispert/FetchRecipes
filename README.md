### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I spent a fair amount of time on the Networking module, to make it scalable and testable.
My other area of focus was the UI, to create a simple but friendly design, incorporating a few handy details and accessibility features.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

I spent about 5 or 6 hours. I started working on the Network layer, then models, views and view model and finally test cases

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

AsyncImage uses URLSession under the hood, and that was not allowed, so I guess not using that availabe in SwiftUI was a trade-off

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

Maybe I could've added more accessibility identifiers and traits.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

I included a "test" button on the top left corner to be able to test the different responses and the appâ€™s behaviors.
